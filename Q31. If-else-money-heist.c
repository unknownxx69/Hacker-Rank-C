// You and your friend decided to pull off a heist at a heavily guarded bank vault. The vault is protected by a 10-digit passcode, each digit ranging from 0 to 9. However, the configuration is not as simple as just remembering the passcode. The vault's passcode is not straightforward — three wrong digits are randomly placed at three different positions.

// Your friend, using some sophisticated tool, has managed to decode the correct digits and their positions. He tells you the exact positions (0-indexed) of the incorrect digits and the number by which the dial must be rotated to correct them.

// Your task is to apply these changes and return the final passcode that will successfully open the vault.

// Note: After the number 9, the dial wraps around back to 0.

// Input Format

// Space separated 10-digit vault configuration with 3 wrong digits.
// Three pairs in new line provided, each pair on a new line. Each pair contains:
// The index of the incorrect digit (0-indexed).
// The number by which the dial must be rotated to correct it.
// Constraints

// All inputs are digits from 0 to 9

// Output Format

// Print the final 10-digit space separated passcode with the corrected digits at their respective positions which opens the vault.

// Sample Input 0

// 3 1 4 7 5 4 2 9 5 4
// 3 5
// 7 4
// 1 5
// Sample Output 0

// 3 6 4 2 5 4 2 3 5 4
// Sample Input 1

// 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
// 0 3
// 4 1
// 8 2
// Sample Output 1

// 2 8 7 6 6 4 3 2 3 0
