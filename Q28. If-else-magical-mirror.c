// In the mystical kingdom of Orlon, there lies an enchanted mirror, renowned for revealing secrets of destiny. However, the mirror tests anyone who dares to stand before it by analyzing a single number. The verdict it delivers is based on a set of ancient rules, but beware—only natural numbers are entertained by the mirror!

// A number can hold one of several mystical statuses based on the following conditions:

// Condition 1: The number is even and greater than 10.
// Condition 2: The number is greater than 15 and a multiple of 3.
// Condition 3: The number is a multiple of 7.
// The mirror’s verdict is as follows:

// If the number satisfies all three conditions, it proclaims the number as "SUPERNATURAL".
// If the number satisfies exactly two conditions, it calls the number "MIRACULOUS".
// If the number satisfies exactly one condition, it deems the number "MAGICAL".
// The number is "NORMAL" if none of the magical conditions are met.
// The mirror remains silent for numbers without significance, discarding such attempts with an "INVALID" response.
// Your task is to create a program that simulates the enchanted mirror. Based on the input number, the program should output the mirror's verdict.

// Input Format

// A single integer N, the number provided to the mirror.

// Constraints

// -10^6 ≤ N ≤ 10^6

// Output Format

// A single line, "The verdict for the number [N] is: [RESULT]"

// Sample Input 0

// 18
// Sample Output 0

// The verdict for the number 18 is: MIRACULOUS
// Sample Input 1

// 42
// Sample Output 1

// The verdict for the number 42 is: SUPERNATURAL
// Sample Input 2

// 14
// Sample Output 2

// The verdict for the number 14 is: MIRACULOUS
// Sample Input 3

// 8
// Sample Output 3

// The verdict for the number 8 is: NORMAL
